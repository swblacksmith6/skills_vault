# Screener.in Document Downloader

Fetches company filings that screener.in links in the **Documents** section of a stock page and saves them locally.

## What gets downloaded (newest first)

| Category | Default max | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| Annual reports | 3 | `annual_reports/AR_FY2025.pdf` |
| Concall transcripts | 12 | `concall_transcripts/Transcript_2025-07.pdf` |
| Investor presentations | 12 | `investor_presentations/PPT_2025-07.pdf` |
| Credit rating reports | 3 | `credit_ratings/2025-06-03_icra.pdf` (some agencies serve `.html`) |

Output layout: `<out>/<SYMBOL>/<category>/...` plus `<out>/<SYMBOL>/manifest.json` (source URL + status for every file).

## Workflow

1. **Check dependencies** (once):
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import requests, bs4" || python3 -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Confirm the company if the name is ambiguous.** For names like "HDFC", "Tata", "Adani", "Bajaj", first list matches:
   ```bash
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/screener_docs.py "HDFC" --list-matches
   ```
   Show the user the list and ask which one, unless one match is clearly what they meant. A plain NSE symbol (e.g. `TCS`, `DIXON`) or a screener URL is usually unambiguous.

3. **Download:**
   ```bash
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/screener_docs.py "<stock name or symbol>" --out ~/screener_docs [--pick N]
   ```
   Useful flags:
   - `--pick N` — use the Nth search match
   - `--dry-run` — list what would be downloaded without downloading
   - `--max-ar`, `--max-transcripts`, `--max-ppts`, `--max-ratings` — override limits
   - Pass a full URL (e.g. `https://www.screener.in/company/TCS/consolidated/`) to skip search
   - Use the folder the user asks for in `--out`; otherwise default `~/screener_docs`

   Re-running is safe: already-downloaded files are skipped.

4. **Report back** to the user: the save folder, counts per category from the script's Summary, and any failed items (from `manifest.json`). Don't paste the whole manifest.

## Notes and troubleshooting

- "Maximum" means *up to*: smaller companies often have fewer transcripts/PPTs or no credit ratings. That's normal — report what was found.
- Files are hosted on BSE/NSE/rating-agency sites, not screener itself. The script sends a matching `Referer`; if many BSE/NSE downloads fail with 403, retry later with a larger `--delay` (e.g. `--delay 3`).
- Status `warning: tiny html` means the source returned a stub page instead of the document — mention it to the user and give them the source URL from the manifest.
- If screener starts requiring login, the user can export their `sessionid` cookie: `export SCREENER_SESSIONID=...` before running.
- If the parse finds 0 items in every category, screener's page layout may have changed: fetch the page, inspect the `#documents` section, and update the selectors in `parse_documents()` (`div.annual-reports`, `div.credit-ratings`, `div.concalls`).
- Be polite to screener.in: don't loop over large stock lists without a delay.
